Note that this assumes a local install of Docker (I'm running on a macbook) and aws cli tool.  I'm sure the steps below are not fully complete but this will be directionally accurate:

--> Dockerfile
  based on: FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python
  OS package dependencies can be tricky
  python dependencies hard-coded into Dockerfile
  use entrypoint file


--> build local Docker image
  build from M1 mac requires extra care
	using the following commands:

 !! replace the ECR path in the commands below with your specific URI !!

aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789123.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
	* for aws cli ensure .aws has the proper credentials set

docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --provenance=false -t {image-name} .

    --platform linux/amd64: This is the crucial part. It forces Docker to build the image to be compatible with a standard x86_64 Linux 
	environment, which is what AWS Lambda uses by default
    --provenance=false:  prevents Docker from adding extra metadata manifests that are not supported by lambda.
    -t <your_image_name>: Tags your image with a name

docker tag {showname:latest} 123456789123.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/{namespace}
docker push 123456789123.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/{namespace}


--> build lambda from uploaded image into AWS ECR
  select create function from "Container Image"
  select the URI from the ECR where uploaded
  x86_64 architecture


--> configure lambda environment 
  set timeout ~45 sec 
  set memory to 2048MB  (adjust both as necessary)
  run test with empty JSON to invoke function


--> remove lambda from the VPC or a NAT gateway ($$) must be setup to permit lambda to reach internet


--> Python file adjustments
  there are considerably more "headless" browser options that must be set
  os.environ['HOME'] = '/tmp' as /tmp is the only writable directory in the Lambda executable environment
